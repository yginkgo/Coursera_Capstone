# Personal project to explore Chicago
## Project_Chicago:
  based on wards of the city.
  describe the number of business (by category); public rec area(by category); crime count (by type) public transportation (L train and Divvy) in the city. 
  cluster wards based on all variables. 
  
## Project_Covid19:
  Just a quick daily dashboard for me and friend, data courtesy to CSSEGISandData.
  quick chart and choropleth of total case vs death, and daily growth. 
  
## Covid_IL(under construction):
  based on zip code.
  explore case and trend by zip code; top small business in the zip code; maybe demographic data by zip.
  identify if there is a correlation between type of business and case
